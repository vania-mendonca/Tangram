{"name":"Le InsTangram 3D","tagline":"Three-Dimensional Visualization and Animation Project","body":"### Concept\r\nLe InsTangram 3D is an interactive application where the user can build 3D figures with the seven Tangram pieces. These pieces can be translated or rotated, and their reflection appears on a mirror placed on top of a wood table.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to view the scene from different points of view and apply image filters (individually or a combination of several filters). It is also possible to save the current figure configuration in order to access the next time one opens the application, as well as to save a screenshot of the scene at a given moment.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThis project was developed in C++ and OpenGL in the context of Three-Dimensional Visualization and Animation, a MSc course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n* @davidcalimero\r\n* @pardalgod\r\n* @soraiamenesesalarcao\r\n* @vania-mendonca","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
